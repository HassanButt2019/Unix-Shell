# Unix-Shell
A shell program is an application that allows interacting with the computer.In a shell the user can run programs and also redirect the input to come from a file and output to come from a file.Shells also provide programming constructions such as **if , for , while , functions , variables , etc.**. Additionally , shell programs offer features such as line editing , history , file complition , wild cards , enviroment variable expension , and programming construction.
## Parts Of a Shell Program
The shell implementation is divided into three parts: **The Parser , The Executor  , and   Shell Subsystems**.
## The Parser
 The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls ­al” and puts it into a data structure called ​Command Table​ that will store the commands that will be executed.  
## The Executor 
The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections.
